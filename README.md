# cordova-cli

> The command line tool to build, deploy and manage [Cordova](http://cordova.io)-based applications.

# Requirements

* [nodejs](http://nodejs.org/)
* SDKs for every platform you wish to support
  - [BlackBerry WebWorks SDK](http://developer.blackberry.com)
  - [iOS SDK](http://developer.apple.com) with the latest Xcode and Xcode Command Line Tools
  - [Android SDK](http://developer.android.com) - **NOTE** This tool
    will not work unless you have the absolute latest updates for all
    Android SDK components. Also you will need the SDK's `tools` and `platform-tools` directories on your __system path__ otherwise Android support will fail.

cordova-cli has been tested on Mas OS X and Linux.

# Install

```
npm install -g cordova
```

**NOTE**: on Unix-based machines, you may want to change the owner of the cordova directory that npm installs to. This will allow you to run cordova as local user without requiring root permissions. Assuming your node_modules directory is in `/usr/local/lib/`, you can do this by running: 

    sudo chown -R <username> /usr/local/lib/node_modules/cordova

# Getting Started

cordova-cli has a single global `create` command that creates new cordova projects into a specified directory. Once you create a project, `cd` into it and you can execute a variety of project-level commands. Completely inspired by git's interface.

## Global Command

- `create <directory> [<id> [<name>]]` create a new cordova project with optional name and id (package name, reverse-domain style)

<a name="project_commands" />
## Project Commands

- `platform [ls | list]` list all platforms the project will build to
- `platform add <platform> [<platform> ...]` add one (or more) platforms as a build target for the project
- `platform [rm | remove] <platform> [<platform> ...]` removes one (or more) platforms as a build target for the project
- `plugin [ls | list]` list all plugins added to the project
- `plugin add <path-to-plugin> [<path-to-plugin> ...]` add one (or more) plugins to the project
- `plugin [rm | remove] <plugin-name> [<plugin-name> ...]` remove one (or more) added plugins
- `prepare [platform...]` copies files into the specified platforms, or all platforms. it is then ready for building by Eclipse/Xcode/etc.
- `compile [platform...]` compiles and deploys the app to a connected and compatible device. With no parameters, builds for all platforms, otherwise builds for the specified platforms.
- `build [<platform> [<platform> [...]]]` an alias for `cordova prepare` followed by `cordova compile`
- `emulate [<platform> [<platform> [...]]]` launch emulators and deploy app to them. With no parameters emulates for all platforms added to the project, otherwise emulates for the specified platforms
- `serve <platform> [port]` launch a local web server for that platform's www directory on the given port (default 8000).


# Project Directory Structure
A Cordova application built with cordova-cli will have the following directory structure:

    myApp/
    |--.cordova/
    |-- merges/
    | |-- android/
    | |-- blackberry/
    | `-- ios/
    |-- platforms/
    | |-- android/
    | |-- blackberry/
    | `-- ios/
    |-- plugins/
    `-- www/

## .cordova/
This directory identifies a tree as a cordova project. Simple configuration information is stored in here (such as BlackBerry environment variables).

Commands other than `create` operate against the project directory itself, rather than the current directory - a search up the current directory's parents is made to find the project directory. Thus, any command (other than `create`) can be used from any subdirectory whose parent is a cordova project directory (same as git).

## merges/
Platform-specific web assets (HTML, CSS and JavaScript files) are contained within appropriate subfolders in this directory. These are deployed during a `prepare` to the appropriate native directory.  Files placed under `merges/` will override matching files in the `www/` folder for the relevant platform. A quick example, assuming a project structure of:

    merges/
    |-- ios/
    | `-- app.js
    |-- android/
    | `-- android.js
    www/
      `-- app.js

After building the Android and iOS projects, the Android application will contain both `app.js` and `android.js`. However, the iOS application will only contain an `app.js`, and it will override the "common" `app.js` located inside the `www/` folder above.

## platforms/
Platforms added to your application will have the native application project structures laid out within this directory.

## plugins/
Any added plugins will be extracted or copied into this directory.

## www/
Contains the project's web artifacts, such as .html, .css and .js files. These are your main application assets. The config.xml file within this directory is very important; read on to the next section!

### Your Blanket: www/config.xml 

This file is what you should be editing to modify your application's metadata. Any time you run any cordova-cli commands, the tool will look at the contents of `config.xml` and use all relevant info from this file to define native application information. cordova-cli supports changing your application's data via the following elements inside the `config.xml` file:

- The user-facing name can be modified via the contents of the `<name>` element.
- The package name (AKA bundle identifier or application id) can be modified via the `id` attribute from the top-level `<widget>` element.
- The whitelist can be modified using the `<access>` elements. Make sure the `origin` attribute of your `<access>` element points to a valid URL (you can use `*` as wildcard). For more information on the whitelisting syntax, see the [docs.phonegap.com](http://docs.phonegap.com/en/2.2.0/guide_whitelist_index.md.html#Domain%20Whitelist%20Guide). You can use either attribute `uri` ([BlackBerry-proprietary](https://developer.blackberry.com/html5/documentation/access_element_834677_11.html)) or `origin` ([standards-compliant](http://www.w3.org/TR/widgets-access/#attributes)) to denote the domain.
- Platform-specific preferences can be customized via `<preference>` tags. See [docs.phonegap.com](http://docs.phonegap.com/en/2.3.0/guide_project-settings_index.md.html#Project%20Settings) for a list of preferences you can use.

# Hooks

Projects created by cordova-cli have `before` and `after` hooks for each [project command](#project_commands). There are two types of hooks: project-specific ones and module-level ones.

## Project-specific Hooks

These are located under the `.cordova/hooks` directory in the root of your cordova project. Any scripts you add to these directories will be executed before and after the appropriate commands. Useful for integrating your own build systems or integrating with version control systems. __Remember__: make your scripts executable.

### Examples

- [`before_build` hook for jade template compiling](https://gist.github.com/4100866) courtesy of [dpogue](http://github.com/dpogue)

## Module-level Hooks

If you are using cordova-cli as a module within a larger node application, you can also use the standard `EventEmitter` methods to attach to the events. The events include `before_build`, `before_compile`, `before_docs`, `before_emulate`, `before_platform_add`, `before_platform_ls`, `before_platform_rm`, `before_plugin_add`, `before_plugin_ls`, `before_plugin_rm` and `before_prepare`. Additionally, there are `after_` flavours of all the above events.

# Examples

## Creating a new cordova project
This example shows how to create a project from scratch named KewlApp with iOS and Android platform support, and includes a plugin named Kewlio. The project will live in ~/KewlApp

    cordova create ~/KewlApp KewlApp
    cd ~/KewlApp
    cordova platform add ios android
    cordova plugin add http://example.org/Kewlio-1.2.3.tar.gz
    cordova build 

The directory structure of KewlApp now looks like this:

    KewlApp/
    |- .cordova/
    |- mergess/
       |- android/
       `- ios/
    |- platforms/
       |- android/
       |  `- …
       `- ios/
          `- …
    |- plugins/
       `- Kewlio/
    `- www/
       `- index.html
